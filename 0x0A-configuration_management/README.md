Puppet Mode lets you edit Puppet 3 manifests with GNU Emacs 24.

Puppet Mode is a major mode for GNU Emacs 24 which adds support for the Puppet language. Puppet is a system provisioning and configuration tool by Puppetlabs Inc. This mode supports Puppet 3 and later. Puppet 2 is not explicitly supported anymore, but should mostly work.

This mode needs GNU Emacs 24. It will not work with GNU Emacs 23 and below, or with other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs).

Features
 1. Syntax highlighting
 2. Indentation and alignment of expressions and statements
 3. Tag navigation (aka imenu)
 4. Manual validation and linting of manifests (see Flycheck for on-the-fly validation and linting)
Integration with Puppet Debugger

Installation
_________________________________________________________________________

From MELPA or MELPA Stable with M-x package-install RET puppet-mode. Users of Debian â‰¥11 and derivatives can sudo apt install elpa-puppet-mode. Manifest validation and linting support is enabled by installing the elpa-flycheck package.

In your Cask file:

(source melpa)

(depends-on "puppet-mode")

Just visit Puppet manifests. The major mode is enabled automatically for Puppet manifests with the extension .pp.
