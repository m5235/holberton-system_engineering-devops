OSI model:
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.


OSI model

Layer	Protocol data unit (PDU)	Function[19]
Host

layers	7	Application	Data	High-level APIs, including resource 
sharing, remote file access

6	Presentation	Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption

5	Session	Managing communication sessions, i.e., continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes

4	Transport	Segment, Datagram	Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing
Media

layers	3	Network	Packet	Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control

2	Data link	Frame	Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer

1	Physical	Symbol	Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium


Types of Area Networks
Common types of area networks are:

 * LAN: Local Area Network

  * WAN: Wide Area Network

  * WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network

* MAN: Metropolitan Area Network

* SAN: Storage Area Network, System Area Network, Server Area Network, or sometimes Small Area Network

* CAN: Campus Area Network, Controller Area Network, or sometimes Cluster Area Network

* PAN: Personal Area Network

* LAN and WAN are the two primary and best-known categories of area networks, while the others have emerged with technology advances.
